# absinthe-clf
Absinthe Configurable Logic Framework

## Project Goals
This is the beginning of what will have to be a very large and complex project.  There are a lot of goals and where this is going to go is not well defined, so we'll see.  The following are some near-term goals:

- [ ] Configure cross-platform Python build environment (command line scripts)
- [ ] Implement extensible RISC-V32i ALU as Python module to validate MyHDL toolchain.
- [ ] Develop configurable RISC-V soft core for FPGA implementation.

## Quick Start
This project creates a Python3 virtual environment in the absinthe-clf project directory.  Needed modules are installed into that virtual environment.

To configure build environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/edwardgjohns3/absinthe-clf.git
cd absinthe-clf
python3 dodo.py
```
To run build:
```bash
python3 dodo.py
```
