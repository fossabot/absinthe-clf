Introduction

The Absinthe Configurable Logic Framework (:index:`Absinthe-CLF`) is in active development (when I have time).  The long term goal is to create a toolchain for embedded systems developers to parametrically create soft core processors that meet specific design goals while using a consistent set of design tools. The project is currently in vaporware status, but given time and improvements that will likely change.
