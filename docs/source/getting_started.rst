Getting Started
***************

In order to use Absinth-CLF, Python 3 must be installed on the development workstation.  Absinthe-CLF creates a Python3 virtual environment in the absinthe-clf project directory. All required modules are installed into that virtual environment.

To download the project:

.. code-block:: console

  $ git clone https://github.com/edwardgjohns3/absinthe-clf.git
  $ cd absinthe-clf

To configure the toolchain and perform build:

.. code-block:: console

  $ python3 dodo.py
